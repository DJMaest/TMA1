<h1>Unit 2: Clientside Javascript</h1>

<p>In this unit we will discuss the fundamentals of javascript as a client side side scripting language.</p>
<hr />
<div class="content">
    <h2>Javscript</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Javascript is essentially the standard clientside scripting language. So far we have learned about html and css.
        These technologies allow us to render
        visually stunning layouts and pages. However, our pages still miss a key ingredient. They are all static and
        lack the dynamic and responsive side. Our html and css pages
        essentially can't "do something". The solution to making our pages dynamic and have the ability to handle
        various inputs and events is Javascript. Javascript allows are pages to come to life and
        be responsive in the sense of handling events and responding to inputs.
    </p>
    <h3>Features of Javascript</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <bold>Window object</bold>: Window object essentially gives us access to the browser window. We can use this
            to reload a browser window or detect when a window has loaded using "window.onload()".
            We can also display alert messages on the browser using for exampe, "window.alert("This is an alert!");".
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>DOM Manipulation</bold>: DOM stands for Document Object Model. Using javascript you can access the
            document object. The document object is
            an abstraction of a corrosponding rendered html document.
            using dockument we can print out text using "document.writeline("Some String");" for example which prints
            out the string to the body of the document.
            We can also use dom objects in order to dynamically change their style. For instance, "domObject.style.color
            = 'green'" is an illustration of what can be done.
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>Case sensitive</bold>: Variables and methods in javascript are case sensitive. This is common in other
            programming languages as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>Mathematical operations</bold>: Javascript supports multiple arithmetic operations such as +,-,/,*;
            Other operations such as rounding down can also be performed using
            the Math object. For example "Math.floor(1.43);".
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>Case sensitive</bold>: Variables and methods in javascript are case sensitive. This is common in other
            programming languages as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>String manipulation</bold>: Javascript supports string concatentaion and parsing. For instance,
            you can concatenate two strings using the '+' operand. e.g. 'a' + 'b' will evaluate to 'ab'.
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>Logical operations: </bold> Javascript supports essentially all logical operators, encompassing, OR
            (||), AND (&&), equal (==), not equal (!=), greater than (>), less than (&lt;), etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>Loops: </bold> Javascript supports both while and for loops
        </li>
        <li>
            <bold>Implicit types: </bold> In Javascript data types are determined implicitely and we mainly worry about
            variable scope using "var" and "let"; and variable immutability using "const".
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        <bold>Note:</bold> Javascript has two types of equal operator. Strict equal (===) and equal (==). Strict equal
        is closer to what is seen other programming languages. Using normal equal (==) in javascript
        should be considered with caution. For example "12" == 12 returns true even though one is a string and the other
        is number.
        <bold>Note:</bold> Semi-columns are not necessary in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>
        Declaration of a function starts with the key word "function" followed by the function name, function parameters
        in parenthesis and the function body wrapped in curly braces. The following figure
        illustrates this format.<br />
        <code>
            function function-name(parameter-list)
            {
            &emsp;declarations and statements
            }
        </code>
        Furthermore, there are also built in functions we can take advantage of. For instance using the built in math
        object we can gegerate random numbers between 0 and 1 using
        "Math.random();". We can round down using "Math.floor(number);". There are many useful built in functions and I
        invite you to take a look at the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects">Mozilla developer
            docs</a> for this and more.
    </p>
    <h3>Handling Events</h3>
    <p>
        There are two way to approach this. We can use inline event handlers or external event handlers that are
        referenced using script tags.
        Inline events can be referenced using attributes such as "onclick="eventHandler()"". Here "eventHandler()" is
        the name of the javascript function
        that is called when the element is clicked.<br />
        e.g. &lt;button onclick="handleClick()" &gt; Some button &lt;/ button&gt; calls handleClick(), where it can be
        defined in a script tag or within a javascript file.<br />
        <code>
            function handleClick()
            {
            &emsp;window.alert("Clicked!");
            }
        </code>
        For external event handlers, we need to use DOM extraction techniques to store DOM objects in javascript object
        and attach an event handler to these objects.
        For example, if our button has an id attribute, then we can use this id attribute to reference this element and
        store it in a javascript object using a document query.<br />
        e.g. &lt;button id="specialButton" &gt; Some button &lt;/ button&gt; <br />
        We can handle click events with the following javascript snippet: <br />
        <code>
            const buttonObject = document.getElementById("specialButton");
            buttonObject.addEventListener("click", ()=> {
                &emsp;window.alert("Clicked!");
            });
        </code>

    <h2>Canvas HTML5</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Canvas is a widely supported html5 element that provides a javascript API with methods that can
        be used to draw 2 dimensional graphics, manipulating images, and inserting videos and images.
        In fact canvas is used in part 3 of this project to create an image slide show. Feel free to take a closer a
        look at it!
    </p>
    <h3>Drawing With Canvas</h3>
    <p>
        Canvas uses a coordinate system where the x values refer to a horizontale distance from origin and y values
        refer to vertical distance from origin. The following
        figure (Taken from textbook) illustrates how canvas can be used to draw rectandles with different borders.
    </p>
    <img style="transform: translate(35%, 0);" width="500px" height="600px"
        src="../../shared/images/part2/canvas-example.png" alt="canvas-example" />
    <p>
        As we can see here the canvas has been styled with a border of 1px, solid and black. Inside the canvas we have
        drawn
        The rectangle's top left corner is on coordinate (5px, 10px) and it has a width of 200px and height of 75px.
        For more on canvas and it's awesome use cases I invite you to take a look at w3schools tutorials on it: <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">canvas tutorial</a>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        In this section we learned about javascript and it's key features. We learned how to handle events such as
        button clicks using javascript. Lasltly, we touched on the concept of canvas, which can be used
        for 2d graphical illustrations and image representations. Canvas is alse used in this project for the slideshow
        application. <br />
